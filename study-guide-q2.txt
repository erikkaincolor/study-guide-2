Dictionaries

    Why are dictionaries necessary? Why not use a list?
-dictonaries are to store data with key values, they hold sets in a categorical way, the values can be data structures, dont have to rmbr position 
-can access values with KEYS instead of INDEX
    How is the lookup time in a dictionary different from that of a list?
-with dictionaries you can access exactly what you need with the key, so its faster and direct
    How do you create an empty dictionary? How do you create a dictionary with initial content?
you initialize it "dict={}" OR "dict={key1:[2,2,3,4], key3:1}
    How do you add a new key/value pair to a dictionary? How do you update the value of a key in a dictionary?
-If the key exists, the value is updated....."dict['names']= 2"
    How do you remove a key/value pair from a dictionary?
via the delete keyword. >>> del animals['rabbit']
    How do you look up the value for a given key in a dictionary?
>>>animals["date"]=
    
    How do you iterate over a dictionary?
     -for loop through i which will be the keys 
    - "Iterating over dictionaries gets each key"
animals = {'goat': 6, 'pony': 1, 'duck': 14}
for animal in animals:
  print(f"key is {animal}")
  print (f"value is {animals[animal]}")





        Print keys?
    for animal in animals:
        print(animal) <----print key
        
        Print values?
    for animal in animals:
        print (animals[animal]) <---print value of animals{}

        Print keys and values?
animals = {'goat': 6, 'pony': 1, 'duck': 14}
for animal in animals:
  print(f"key is {animal}")
  print (f"value is {animals[animal]}")

    What is a KeyError? When does one occur?
Attempting to index into a dictionary with a nonexistant key results in a KeyError
    
    Dictionary methods to know: <----AN API..https://www.w3schools.com/PYTHON/python_dictionaries_methods.asp

        .get()<-----takes a key as a arg....returns the value of the key in the parenthesis; "dict.get("key")"<-----

        .values()<-----no arg....returns a new view of the dictionarys keys; "dict.values()"<---can b a for loop 

        .items()<------no arg.....returns dicts items, the key:value pairs; "dict.items()" <---can b a for loop

    How do you access a dictionary within a dictionary?
^^you access a nested dictionary by using 1st key and second key "dict[key1][key2]"

-Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:

#not resolved
dict1={dict1key:1}
dict2={dict2key:11}
dict3={dict3key:111}
all_dict={dict1,dict2, dict3}

    When should you use a dictionary?
when you want to access something quick

    What are some characteristics of Python as compared to other programming languages?
-easy, pretty,english seeming , strongly typed
    What are .pyc files? What is their purpose?
-. py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, . pyc file contains the bytecode of your program.
    What’s the difference between the commands python3 mygame.py and python3 -i mygame.py?
-one is the python console and the other is the interactive python console
    
    Built-in Python functions to know:

        dir() <----Display the methods of an object...."dir(class_name)"...Lists out all the obtainable attributes for module, lists, and dictionaries

Shell

    VS Code shortcuts to know and use:

        CTRL-/ to comment/uncomment 

        CTRL-] and CTRL-[ to indent/dedent (or tab and shift + tab)

    Shell shortcuts and commands to know and use:

        Tab completion <----------------terminal will complete file name 

        Up arrow/Down arrow to navigate history

        CTRL-A to go to beginning of line

        CTRL-E to go to end of line

        CTRL-D to delete moving forward

        head <some file name>   <--------------print the top N number of data of lines of the file.

        cat <some file name>   <---------------CREATE single or multiple files, VIEW content of a file, CONCANTENATE files and REDIRECT output in terminal or files.

        tail <some file name>   <--------------print the last N number of lines of the file.

        wc <some file name>   <----------------return the # of lines in a file, the number of characters in a file and the number of words in a file

        sort <some file name>   <---------------sorting alphabetically, in reverse order, by number, by month, and can also remove duplicates

        grep <term> <some file name>
^^^GREP is a useful command-line tool that lets us use regular expressions to search plain text files for specified lines. 





In Python, regular expressions (RE) are commonly used to determine whether a string matches a specific pattern

???
        env
coding ina n environemnt using environemtn specific variables...
        echo $PATH
-$PATH is a environment variable that is file location-related


PATH is an environment variable used to find programs.

Q: When you run where does the shell look for python3?

>>> echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

The shell will search the PATH value from left to right, 
and stop when it finds the first path containing the command. 
If it never finds the command, it will return command not found.

>>>study-guide-week-2 % echo $PATH
/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/
3.10/bin:/usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:

Python Projects

    What is a Python module?
a set of functions that u can use in file by importing
    What is a namespace?
the menu of identifiers available for use in a file 
    What are the 3 ways to import something in Python?
1-import c 
2-from c import this
3-from c import *

    Why is from some_module import * not a good practice?
imports one singular thing
    When should you import a whole library versus only one function, class, etc.?
when using multiple
    What does if __name__ == "__main__" ask? When should you include this check at the bottom of your file?
-dunder!!! if the name after "python3" is the 
file thats being run...interactive python....when 
doing doctests and running server in debug mode 
-tests running the file directly vs when being importeed into another file 
    Where are the three places that you can import things from?
std library
another script
classes
    What is pip?
package mgr for python
    What is a virtual environment? How is that different than a virtual machine?
-its what u set up when u want the dependancies to be consistent, goes hand in hand with the requirements.txt file 
-a virtual machine is literally a machine copy on another machine
    Why are virtual environments necessary?
-dependacnies sake...has version of packages and libraries you used at the time o fmaking the program
    How do you create a virtual environment? How do you activate it?
-run 'virtualenv env' in shell
    What command can you use to view the currently installed Python libraries?
-pip3 freeze
    What should you name the file that has the list of a Python project’s dependencies?
requirements.txt
Classes

    How are classes different than dictionaries in terms of structure, flexibility, and data storage?
classes are objects that hold all sorts of identifying info, and functions (their methods)
    What is the relationship between a class and an instance?
an instance is 1 instantiaction of a class object.....if the class is people, the instances would be sarah, erikka, taylor etc
    What is instantiation?
when u bring a class object to life.
    What are attributes? How do you define an attribute at the class level (to be shared by all instances)? How do you set a new attribute on an instance? How can you update the value of an attribute on an instance?
the data in the class, in the dunder...a function....another function
    What is a method? How do you define a method on a class? How do you call a method?
a function in a class, 
    What are the key differences between functions and methods?
functions can apply to anything
    What is initialization? How is it different than instantiation?
A variable is initialized with a value. An object is instantiated when memory is allocated for it and it's constructor has been run
    What is __init__? When does it get called?
dunder! it gets called when a instance is instantiated. 
    What is encapsulation? What is abstraction? What is polymorphism?

    Data lives close to its functionality=Encapsulation
    Don’t need to know info a method uses internally=Abstraction
    Easy to make different, interchangeable types of class objects=Polymorphism

    What is inheritance? When is it appropriate for one class to inherit attributes and/or methods from another?
child and parent classes, superclasses 
-when a child inherits from a parent class and can use its attributes + its own....via super or by creating there own dunder repr.
    What are the various ways in which a child class can modify methods and attributes from a parent class?
+Like this:
class Cat(Animal):
    max_purr_vol = 10
parent, superclass = animal, subclass of animal = cat....

+ALSO via the dunder repr- This method allows you to define what will appear when you print the object
class Cat(Animal):

    def greet(self):
        msg = super().greet()
        return f"{msg} You seem awesome."




    What is super()?
Why copy and paste __init__ when we have super?
+like this:
class Cat(Animal):
    # (...snippet)

    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, "cat")



    What’s an example of violating polymorphism? What’s an example of enforcing polymorphism?
1:
for some_animal in family_animals:

if some_animal.species == "dog":
    some_animal.speak()

elif some_animal.species == "cat":
    some_animal.meow()

2:
having a class method with lots of conditionals





    When overriding parent methods, what is the only method that is normal to require different arguments than the parent method?
dunder inits pre-determined attributes 

class Cat(Animal):
    # (...snippet)

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.species = "cat"


    What is an abstract class? What makes it different than a typical class?
abstract classes are classes that 

    When there are methods that don’t directly map to an existing hierarchy, 
    how can you continue to pursue encapsulation? (i.e. avoid copying the same 
    method on several classes)

Data lives close to its functionality, Keeping everything “together”...create some mixins 
that apply an attribute to all classes!

-A mixin is a class used to supply a feature to its subclasses...different 
subclasses of Animals (dogs, cats, fish), but i want to add glitter to all their skin, id create
a mixin called Glitter and add it when creating their instances

To make cats furry and love lasers, Cat can inherit from all 3 superclasses:

class Cat(ChaseLaserMixin, HasFurMixin, Animal):
    # (...snippet)

class Dog(HasFurMixin, Animal):
    # (...snippet)


class HairlessRobot(ChaseLaserMixin, Animal):
    # (...snippet)
